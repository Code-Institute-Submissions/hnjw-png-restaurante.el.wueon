references of photos used:
header image is a image from: https://www.pexels.com/photo/landscape-of-andes-13203423/
the rest of the photos are my own privately photographed images.

errors: footer keep floating towards the main content on the contact us page. Tried mulitple attempts (now fixed) 
I fixed this with adding a bit more content on the contact us page, this worked nicely and helped the website correlate with the rest of the website.
